The math teacher, Mr. Johnson, is preparing students for an upcoming Math Olympics competition, and he wants to create study groups to foster collaborative learning. Mr. Johnson seeks your assistance in automating the process of dividing students into equal-sized teams, taking into account any remaining students who can assist with additional math challenges. Can you provide a program that takes the total number of students and the desired number of study groups as input and outputs the number of students in each study group along with the count of remaining students?
